      My site consists of an index, about, contact, upcoming event, and clients
      page. The site is meant to be a portfolio-like website for a photographer.
      The home page contains random images from picsum.photos. The About page
      uses an image from
      <a href="https://unsplash.com/@samr1os_official"
        >Samuel Rios on Unsplash</a
      >. Each page has the same camera icon for its favicon, as well as a
      header, navication links, responsive layout, and images with alt
      attributes. Each page also validated with the Nu Validator and passed the
      WAVE Web Accessibility Evauator. The site uses two different font-faces.
      Inconsolata for all headers, and IBM Plex Sans for everything else. Two
      forms are included on the Contact page, one that accepts an email address
      and one that accepts multiple lines of text. The email form will check or
      a valid email format upon submission. The upcoming events/shows page
      includes external links to the galleries that these hypothetical shows
      will be ocurring in. Because of the way github handles the addresses of
      pages, in order to make links between pages work right every link is
      structured like an external link. I didn't know of a way around this. <a href="./design/design.pdf">Here is the .PDF
